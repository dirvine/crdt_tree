//! Implements `LogOpMove`, a log entry used by `State`
//!
//! For usage/examples, see:
//!   examples/tree.rs
//!   test/tree.rs
//!
//! This code aims to be an accurate implementation of the
//! tree crdt described in:
//!
//! "A highly-available move operation for replicated trees
//! and distributed filesystems" [1] by Martin Klepmann, et al.
//!
//! [1] <https://martin.kleppmann.com/papers/move-op.pdf>
//!
//! For clarity, data structures in this implementation are named
//! the same as in the paper (`State`, `Tree`) or close to
//! (`OpMove` --> `Move`, `LogOpMove` --> `LogOp`).  Some are not explicitly
//! named in the paper, such as TreeId, TreeMeta, TreeNode, Clock.

/// From the paper:
/// ----
/// In order to correctly apply move operations, a replica needs
/// to maintain not only the current state of the tree, but also
/// an operation log.  The log is a list of `LogMove` records in
/// descending timestamp order.  `LogMove` t oldp p m c is similar
/// to Move t p m c; the difference is that `LogMove` has an additional
/// field oldp of type ('n x 'm) option.  This option type means
/// the field can either take the value None or a pair of a node ID
/// and a metadata field.
///
/// When a replica applies a `Move` operation to its tree it
/// also records a corresponding LogMove operation in its log.
/// The t, p, m, and c fields are taken directly from the Move
/// record while the oldp field is filled in based on the
/// state of the tree before the move.  If c did not exist
/// in the tree, oldp is set to None. Else oldp records the
/// previous parent metadata of c: if there exist p' and m'
/// such that (p', m', c') E tree, then `oldp` is set to `Some(p', m')`.
/// The `get_parent()` function implements this.
