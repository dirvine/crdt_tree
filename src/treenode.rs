//! Implements `TreeNode`, ie a node that is stored in a `Tree`.
//!
//! For usage/examples, see:
//!   examples/tree.rs
//!   test/tree.rs
//!
//! This code aims to be an accurate implementation of the
//! tree crdt described in:
//!
//! "A highly-available move operation for replicated trees
//! and distributed filesystems" [1] by Martin Klepmann, et al.
//!
//! [1] <https://martin.kleppmann.com/papers/move-op.pdf>
//!
//! For clarity, data structures in this implementation are named
//! the same as in the paper (`State`, `Tree`) or close to
//! (`OpMove` --> `Move`, `LogOpMove` --> `LogOp`).  Some are not explicitly
//! named in the paper, such as `TreeId`, `TreeMeta`, `TreeNode`, `Clock`.
